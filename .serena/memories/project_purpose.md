# KIE v3 - Kearney Insight Engine

## Purpose
KIE is an AI-powered consulting delivery platform that transforms natural language requirements into polished, brand-compliant deliverables (presentations, dashboards, reports).

## Core Philosophy
**"LLM Reasons, Python Executes"**
- Claude handles understanding, reasoning, and orchestration
- Python engines handle deterministic, reproducible output generation
- Brand compliance (KDS) is programmatically enforced (cannot be bypassed)

## Key Problem Being Solved
Consulting teams need to rapidly generate KDS-compliant deliverables from data without:
- Manual formatting/styling
- Brand violations
- Synthetic/fake data
- Inconsistent outputs

## Primary User Persona
Management consultants (Kearney) who need to:
- Upload data (CSV/Excel)
- Get automatic insights via AI
- Generate client-ready PowerPoint/dashboards
- Ensure 100% KDS brand compliance
