description: Start conversational requirements gathering
---

I'll gather your project requirements through natural conversation.

Let me ask you some questions:

**1. What are you building?**
- Analytics/insights from data?
- A presentation for executives?
- An interactive dashboard?
- A predictive model?
- Something else?

**2. Who is this for?**
- Client executives?
- Internal team?
- Trading desk?
- Analysts?

**3. What's your objective?**
What question are you trying to answer, or what decision are you trying to support?

**4. What data do you have?**
(If you haven't already, drop your data file or tell me where it is)

**5. Theme preference?**
- Dark mode (default - Kearney standard)
- Light mode

**6. What deliverables do you need?**
- Charts and insights (analytics)
- PowerPoint presentation
- Interactive dashboard (HTML/React)
- Excel export
- All of the above?

Answer these questions naturally - you don't need to follow the format exactly. Just tell me about your project and I'll extract the requirements and save them to `project_state/spec.yaml`.
