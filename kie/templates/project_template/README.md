# KIE Project

## Quick Start

1. **Drop your data file** into the chat or `data/` folder
2. **Describe what you want** in plain English
3. **Let Claude (KIE)** create brand-compliant deliverables

That's it! Claude will guide you through the rest.

## Folder Structure

```
data/           - Put your data files here
outputs/        - Generated charts appear here
exports/        - Final deliverables (PPTX, etc.)
project_state/  - Project tracking
```

## Available Commands

- `/interview` - Start a new project (gather requirements)
- `/build` - Create deliverables from your data
- `/review` - Check brand compliance
- `/startkie` - Initialize KIE in a new folder

## Tips

- Just describe what you need naturally
- Say "preview" to see what's been generated
- Say "export" when ready for final deliverables
- KIE enforces Kearney brand standards automatically
